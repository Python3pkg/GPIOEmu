Note about the images:
The .bmp files are used by the SDL (exported from image manipulation programs such as the GIMP or InkScape). There are also corresponding .xcf (the GIMP) or .svg (InkScape) files, allowing you to easily improve the ugly images using the awesome GIMP or the (still awesome) InkScape, or your favorite image manipulation free (as in freedom) program (if you do it, don't forget to create a pull request on our repository replacing our images by yours!) ! Note the "free" word: we do not want images made using proprietary programs.

Every images in this directory are released under the WTFPL terms (I could say "unlicensed" instead).
